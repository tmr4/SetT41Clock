# SetT41Clock

Set the T41 clock from your PC with this .NET Maui app.

## Build

Create a new .NET Maui app project in Visual Studio 2022 and replace the autogenerated MainPage files with the ones in this repository.  If you run it in Windows it will create a SetT41Clock app that you can then use anytime to set your T41 clock.  This is supposed to work on other platforms as well (a feature of .Net Maui) but I haven't tested that.

## Use

Requires my [T41_SDR](https://github.com/tmr4/T41_SDR) software which must be compiled with a `Dual` or `Triple` USB Type. Select the appropriate COM port (not the one you normally use to program the T41).  That's it, the T41 clock should be set.   It's clunky, but get's the job done.
